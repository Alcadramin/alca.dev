# Who am I & What I do 👨‍💻

<hr />

In high school, I dipped my toes into programming with Lua, embracing the role of a modder. College led me to C++, and now, I find joy as a JavaScript developer, infusing warmth into my code.

Currently, my focus revolves around React. Alongside, I delve into Python, reveling in the sweet symphony of Machine Learning. And, just for laughs (and to keep the fridge stocked), I code with PHP because a coder's gotta earn their food somehow! 🍔💻

For whimsy, I explore HolyC, brainf*ck, and gems like nim and elixir. Beyond code, I harmonize with databases, CI/CD, Docker, and the vast universe of Unix.

In rare leisure moments, my sanctuary is home. There, I dive into video games, vibe with melodies, and binge-watch on Netflix. Oh, and there's always a bit of [anime](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Alcadramin) in the mix.


Currently crushing it as a **Full Stack Developer** at [Jotform](https://www.jotform.com).
