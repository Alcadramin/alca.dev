## Who am I 👨‍💻

<hr />

> Friendly neighborhood developer.

I started programming in high school with Lua (Modder here) learned C++ at collage nowadays I'm mainly a JavaScript developer and I love coding with JavaScript.

I’m mostly working with with Vue.js and React - Node.js in general. I also have good experience with C++ and Python for Machine Learning sugar.

I do sometimes play with weird languages such as HolyC, brainf\*ck or underrated ones like nim or elixir.

Besides my coding skills I have a really good relationship with Databases, CI/CD, Docker and anything you can think of Unix.
